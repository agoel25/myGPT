## OpenWebText

OpenWebText is "an open-source replication of the WebText dataset from OpenAI, that was used to train GPT-2." 

We will be using this dataset in hopes to train a model as close to GPT-2 as possible.

Note:
Post running `prepare.py` the bin files have the following sizes: train.bin is ~17GB, val.bin ~8.5MB
