My implementation of a generative pre-trained transformer. 

Note: the assert statements you might see in the code are a part of a coding technique called negative space programming. It programs invariance into code to guarantee a specific behavior.  If the code errors out, its much easier to track down the bug. Making assertions about required states governed by calculations or logic have been very helpful to me when writing large scale ML code like this.
